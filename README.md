# Firebase Asynchronous Operation Error: Accessing Snapshot Before Data Load
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase's asynchronous data fetching.  The issue arises when attempting to access properties of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded.  This example uses JavaScript, but the principles apply to other Firebase SDKs.

## Problem
The primary problem is that Firebase's `get()` method is asynchronous.  Attempting to access `doc.data().name` immediately after calling `get()` might result in an error because `doc.data()` could still be `undefined` or `null`.

## Solution
The solution involves proper asynchronous handling with a `then` block to ensure the data is fully loaded before accessing it. This avoids the error and enhances code reliability.  Also, adding error handling provides robustness.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repo
2. Set up your Firebase project and configure your `firebase.json`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run the JavaScript file to reproduce the error
5. Examine the bugSolution.js file to see the corrected code.
